To set up 2-way SSL, where not only the server but also the client needs to present its own SSL certificate to the server. Both will verify each other's SSL certificates, ensuring a fully secure connection.

Generally, it is used for setting up intranet communication within an organization, making it easy and cost-effective by using self-signed SSL certificates.

### Generate self-signed certificates

```bash
mkdir certs
cd certs

# CA Self-signed certificate generation
openssl genrsa -des3 -out CAPrivateKey.key 2048
openssl req -new -key CAPrivateKey.key -out CACertificate.csr
openssl x509 -req -in CACertificate.csr -sha1 -signkey CAPrivateKey.key -CAcreateserial -out CACertificate.pem -days 1095

# Server certificate generation using CACertificate.pem
openssl genrsa -des3 -out ServerPrivateKey.key 2048
openssl req -new -key ServerPrivateKey.key -out ServerCertificate.csr
openssl x509 -req -in ServerCertificate.csr -sha1 -CA CACertificate.pem -CAkey CAPrivateKey.key -CAcreateserial -out ServerPublicCertificate.pem -days 1095
cat ServerPublicCertificate.pem ServerPrivateKey.key CACertificate.pem > ServerCertificate.pem

# Client certificate generation using CACertificate.pem
openssl genrsa -des3 -out ClientPrivateKey.key 2048
openssl req -new -key ClientPrivateKey.key -out ClientCertificate.csr
openssl x509 -req -in ClientCertificate.csr -sha1 -CA CACertificate.pem -CAkey CAPrivateKey.key -CAcreateserial -out ClientPublicCertificate.pem -days 1095

# Decrypt Private key, because a password-protected private key is generally not allowed by most SSL libs or Python's requests module
openssl rsa -in ClientPrivateKey.key -out ClientPrivateKeyUnEncrypted.key
cat ClientPublicCertificate.pem ClientPrivateKeyUnEncrypted.key CACertificate.pem > ClientCertificate.pem
```

#### Note:

- At the time of private key generation, the command will ask to enter a passphrase. The same passphrase can be used for each private key without any issues.
- During CSR (certificate signing requests) generation, enter details as usual like Country, State, etc. Dummy details donâ€™t cause any issues, including dummy common names like ca.site.com, server.site.com, client.site.com, etc.
- Ensure that the common name should be different for all entities like client, server, and certificate authority; otherwise, SSL validation fails for it.
- If you want multiple domains/IPs to be supported by a given certificate, then use SAN (Subject Alternative Names) for it.

Once you have self-signed certificates for the server and client, the client calling the server needs to provide its certificate. For example, if you are using Python's requests library to make HTTP requests, you can use it as shown below.

```python
resp = requests.request(
    url=url,
    method=method,
    data=data,
    headers=headers,
    timeout=timeout,
    verify=True,
    cert=('/path/to/clientCertificate.pem', 'path/to/ClientPrivateKey.key')
)
```

### Some reference commands to verify the setup

```
# To verify if the server's SSL certificate can be trusted given the Certificate Authority (CA) files 
openssl verify -verbose -x509_strict -CAfile ca.pem certificate.pem

# To get the server's SSL certificate chain
openssl s_client -connect localhost:5000 -CAfile ca.pem -showcerts

```
